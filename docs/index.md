## About me

Hi! I'm Katharina, an AI freelancer based in Berlin. I help businesses and developers build AI solutions that actually work—from RAG systems and LLM applications to data pipelines and intelligent automation.

With 10 years across industries, I've learned that the best solutions come from understanding the problem deeply, getting hands dirty with messy data, and shipping pragmatic, maintainable code that solves today's problems. Fast learner who thinks in systems—I see the big picture while debugging the details.

I started my LLM journey like many developers do: curious, eager to learn, and determined to move from theory to practice. What began with building my first meal planner with Claude API has evolved into a passion for rapid prototyping and shipping production-ready AI solutions. I believe the best way to master AI is by building real things that solve real problems.

My tech stack includes Python, Streamlit, FastAPI, Claude/OpenAI APIs, vector databases (FAISS, Pinecone), PostgreSQL, Docker, and cloud deployment.

## Why work with me?

Here's why I'm the right fit and what you'll gain from working together:

-   :material-rocket:{ .lg .middle } Fast Implementation & Shipping

    ---

    I specialize in rapid prototyping and deployment of AI solutions. Coming from a developer mindset, I move quickly without cutting corners. I can help you go from concept to production in weeks, not months, giving you a competitive edge in today's fast-paced AI landscape.

-   :material-lightbulb:{ .lg .middle } Hands-On Technical Expertise

    ---

    I'm a practitioner, not just a theorist. I recently transitioned to freelancing after building real AI systems, so I understand both the technical challenges and the business impact. Whether it's RAG implementation, LLM integration, or data pipeline optimization, I bring battle-tested solutions to the table.

-   :material-chat-processing:{ .lg .middle } Clear Communication

    ---

    I break down complex AI concepts into clear, actionable insights. You'll always understand the 'why' behind technical decisions. I provide regular progress updates, thorough documentation, and collaborate closely with your team to ensure we're aligned every step of the way.

-   :material-school:{ .lg .middle } Continuous Learning & Innovation

    ---

    AI moves fast, and so do I. I'm actively learning the latest techniques and tools, which means you get fresh perspectives and cutting-edge approaches. I stay on top of developments in LLMs, vector databases, and AI best practices so you don't have to.

## Frequently asked questions

??? note "How quickly can you start working on my project?"
    I'm usually ready to kick off new projects within 1-2 weeks after we finalize the contract. If you're working against a tight deadline, I'm happy to discuss accelerated timelines—just give me a heads up during our first conversation about what you're working with.
??? note "Do you require a minimum project size or commitment?"
    I work with projects of all sizes, but I've found that around 20 hours is the sweet spot to really dig into your challenge, understand your data landscape, and deliver solutions that actually move the needle. If you're unsure about fit, we can always start with a smaller pilot to see if we click.
??? note "What industries have you worked in?"
    I've tackled projects in healthcare, retail, and insurance. While the fundamentals of data work transcend industries, I've built particular expertise in understanding customer behavior, streamlining operations, and building predictive models that drive real business outcomes.
??? note "How do you handle data security and confidentiality?"
    Data security isn't negotiable for me. I sign NDAs as standard practice, encrypt all data in transit, and adhere to industry security standards. I'm also comfortable integrating with your existing security setup and compliance requirements—we can work however makes you most comfortable.
??? note "What's your pricing model?"
    I offer both project-based and ongoing retainer options. Project pricing reflects the scope, complexity, and value you'll get—not just hours on the clock. For continuous support, I design retainers that fit your actual needs. Let's talk about your situation and find an approach that makes financial sense.
??? note "How do you keep me in the loop?"
    I believe in transparency. You'll get weekly updates on progress, regular sync meetings, and thorough documentation of everything we discover and build. For longer engagements, I set up dashboards and reports so you can see results as they happen, not just at the end
